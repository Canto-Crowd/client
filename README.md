## Canto Crowd - Bring All Public Good Ideas to Life!

Canto Crowd is your first step to creating something great. It is where open-source developers, dreamers, and builders harness the power of communities and, together, make small ideas into revolutionary projects that can benefit the world. 



## What is Canto Crowd?

Canto Crowd is a decentralized crowdfunding application established on the [Canto](https://canto.io/) Blockchain. The crowdfunding platform is created to help raise funding for innovative open-source projects that aim to create public goods and generate positive social impact. Unlike conventional crowdfunding platforms, Canto Crowd implements the [Quadratic Funding](https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/plural-funding/) (QF) model to facilitate a more democratic, community-based, and mathematically optimal mechanism to fundraise public goods.

The mission of Canto Crowd goes beyond fund allocation. The true value of this Canto-native project is to bring like-minded builders onto the innovative Canto blockchain and sustain this rent-seeking resistant ecosystem while learning and fostering revolutionary ideas together!

## How does Canto Crowd Work?
- Quadratic Funding (QF) model to empower democratic crowdfunding: Canto Crowd allocates funding via the Quadratic Funding (QF) model. The funding received by a project is the amount donated directly by project backers, but each project will receive additional funding provided by the Match Fund, which accounts for the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received minus the actual donation (An example can be found in the illustration below). Under this QF model, the number of backers matters more than the amount contributed, and the project supported by a larger number of backers will benefit more. 

- $NOTE as the main medium to secure the fund raised: $NOTE is the unit of account on the Canto Blockchain. It is an over-collateralized and decentralized currency with an algorithmic interest rate policy that keeps its value continuously rebalanced toward $1 dollar. With $NOTE, the project owners will not suffer from the price volatility of the currency while the encouraged employment of $NOTE can also accelerate the robust ecosystem of the Canto Blockchain.

- Canto Crowd DAO facilitates governance and guarantees decentralization: Building upon the truly decentralized Canto Blockchain, Canto Crowd is governed and managed by the Canto Crowd DAO. To join the DAO, members have to deposit their $NOTE tokens in exchange for $CantoCrowd tokens, which will be used to build the Match Fund and the DAO treasury. The DAO manages the operation, improvements, and changes for the platform without succumbing to power centralization. To keep continuous improvement and offer the best experience on our platform, the Canto Crowd DAO will keep 5% of the allocated funds to cover expenses and continue optimizing the platform.
